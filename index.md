# Computational Linguistics

This is a course on Computational Linguistics. This is a slightly adapted
version of the Computational Linguistics course I gave during the Summer
Semester of 2020 in the Technische Universit√§t Kaiserslautern as part of my
studies there as a PhD student
([I still am a PhD student there](https://jcbgamboa.github.io/public/pages/about/)).

This course was not produced only by me. While the vast majority of the
materials you'll see in this page were edited by me, some of
them were partly organized/produced/written/inspired by
two other people who also gave this lecture in its very first iteration
(in 2018): ...
Still... this does not necessarily mean they endorse everything I say in
my videos.


Context
-------

This course is focused on students of the Master on Cognitive Sciences of
the University of Kaiserslautern. At this point of the Master, the students
normally do not have a lot of programming background, but learnt some Java
in another class. Therefore, I try to be very "gentle" in my introduction
to the command line and to Python. Still, at the very end of this course
we do see some quite-close-to-state-of-the-art applications, so hopefully
the learning curve is not too steep.

When teaching this course, I used an online platform, where I could upload
videos. The platform also offered a forum where students could ask
questions, and a some space for Downloads.
I tried filtering out a few of the references to the
forum and to the "Downloads folder" in the materials, but some of them are
just impossible to remove. So if you find any one I've left in, just
consider that
 * the "Downloads folder" should be interpreted now as the _Downloads_ page
   in the menu to the left;
 * the "forum" should be interpreted now as the comment pages of the
   Youtube videos.



Licence
-------

I am not fully sure I own everything that I am posting here.

For things that I don't own (which I believe are none),
and in case someone who does own something here wants their ownership to be
respected, I am happy to take down whatever they tell me to.

Except for the things listed in the previous paragraph
(which I believe are none), everything here
is licenced according to the following licence (however, read below a few
details):

The following things are owned also by Philipp Blandford (they were mostly
created/idealized by them, and I then heavily changed them for the purposes
of this course).
In these cases, if you use them, mention both of us as authors =)

    * W1 Introduction
    * W3 Introduction
 * **Jupyter notebooks**

For all the other things (the text of the pages, the other jupyter
notebooks, the other slides, and the Youtube videos), you can mention only me
as the author.
