W1 Introduction
===============

Command Line tutorials
----------------------

If you have never used or are not really comfortable with the command line
(the "terminal"), I'd like you to watch the videos in the following links.

For Windows users (watch the first 5 videos):

For Mac users:

Additionally, Mac users should take a look at the fourth video I uploaded
for this week, "PATH tutorial", which is an introduction to the PATH variable.

(I'm assuming you know what you are doing if you are Linux. Otherwise,
watching the Mac users' video is probably good enough)



Installing Python
-----------------

To install Python, take a look at the following video. If you do not have
an Informatics background, I would suggest you to follow the video even if
you think you'll manage to install Python without it. (I'd like to avoid
things like "Conda", because I don't know it and if you end up having
problems with it then I'll possibly not know how to help you)

For both Windows and Mac users:

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

Watch the following video for getting to know what is Jupyter and why it
is useful:

I intend to use Jupyter Notebooks to give you lecture notes almost every
week. Hopefully, this will be a useful way for you to learn by doing.

Take a look at the fifth video I uploaded for this week,
"Jupyter Installation" to have a notion on how to install Jupyter.
