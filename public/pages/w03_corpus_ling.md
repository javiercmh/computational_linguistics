Papers
------

Unfortunately, for copyright reasons, I can't provide copies of the papers I
refer to in these videos. Still... if you _can_ have access to them, I totally
recommend reading them, especially the one applying Corpus Linguistics to
analyse the way people in depressive forums use language.

(By the way: )

Continuing our Python Tutorials
-------------------------------

The last three videos are a continuation of the programming "tutorial".
This time we will see how to access/manipulate corpus data using the NLTK,
using the Gutenberg "package" as an example.
