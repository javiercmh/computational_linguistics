W3 Corpus Linguistics (part 1)
==============================

The "theory" part of the class are the first three videos. You'll find in the
"Download folder" (in the menu to the left) the four papers referred to in the
first video. The files are inside a folder called "Week 3". I totally
recommend reading them.

The fourth video is a description of one of the papers. I think it will be
easier if read the paper after watching the video.

The last three videos are a continuation of the programming "tutorial". The
questions in the Questionnaires will make references to them.
