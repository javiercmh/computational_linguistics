W5 Tokenization
===============

The videos this week contain most of the materials. You can get the slides of
the first and last video in the Downloads Folder.

Additionally, the entire "story" told by the videos is also available a Jupyter
Notebook file in the Downloads Folder too. This file were the lecture notes I
provided the students in the previous year (you can safely ignore the exercises
in the end). There you'll find links to several additional materials in case you
are interested in learning more about Regular Expressions and the theory behind
them.
