W8 Machine Learning (part 3)
============================

Along with the "W8.1" video on Overfitting, I'd like you to watch the video
below. It is more or less a different explanation of the same ideas, and I
think it would be useful for you to watch both:

The jupyter notebooks that I used, as well as the paper that I show in the
last video of this week, are available in the Download Folder.




Part of Speech (POS) tagging
----------------------------

(to be watched after video 3)

Before proceeding to the next video, I'd like you to watch these two videos
from Youtube. I believe you should be able to understand them well with the
information you have so far. Let me know if you have doubts =)

An Intro to Parts of Speech and POS Tagging

Some Methods and Results on Sequence Models for POS Tagging

Additionally, if you still didn't watch those 3Blue1Brown videos on Neural
Networks (the two videos on classifying handwritten digits using a neural
network), I'd like you to stop now, go back to the last week's materials,
and watch it. You will need that information for understanding the last video
of this week.
